JSON Web Token (JWT) authentication is a method of securely authenticating users and allowing them to access protected resources on a website or application.

PROCESS chart:

SERVER generates (signed JWT) => sends to CLIENT
CLIENT includes (signed JWT) => requests to SERVER to authenticating

JWT is usually stored in localStorage
JWT is usually used as a part of REQ Headers

JWT contains:
    1. The HEADER: consists of two-parts - the TOKEN TYPE (=JWT) && SIGNING ALGORITHM (e.g. HMAC-SHA256 or RSA)
    2. the PAYLOAD: contains the claims - the STATEMENTS about an ENTITY (typically, the user) and additional data
    3. the SIGNATURE: used to verify JWT's integrity
